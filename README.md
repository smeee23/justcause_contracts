# JustCause Crowdfunding Solidity Contracts

# About Us
JustCause is a crowdfunding platform that allows users to leverage the power of defi to fund causes that are important to them. We use an innovative funding mechanism to allow users to contribute to public goods, charitable organizations, DAOs, local/global/personal causes, and much more.

Users participate as either Contributors or Pool Creators. Pool Creators generate JustCause Pools representing a cause in need of funding. Contributors deposit tokens into JustCause Pools which in turn deposit them into Aaveâ€™s lending protocol. The interest earned is donated to the cause associated with the Pool. When Contributors need access to their funds, they simply withdraw their original deposit and the interest accrued is left behind for the cause.

# Our Mission
JustCause is an open source, permissionless and non-custodial protocol. This means that anyone has the freedom to create or contribute to pools with a user interface or interact directly with the smart contracts on the network. This freedom lies at the heart of the difference between permissioned (closed) and permissionless (open) systems.

Our mission is to give users the freedom to create and fund any cause they deem worthy. Crowdfunding mechanisms based on traditional financial payment networks are inherently permissioned and custodial. This leaves the funds and users of these systems vulnerable to financial censorship. We want to solve this problem.
