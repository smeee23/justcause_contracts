/**
 * @title Toucan Protocol Offset Helpers
 * @notice Helper functions that simplify the carbon offsetting (retirement)
 * process.
 *
 * Retiring carbon tokens requires multiple steps and interactions with
 * Toucan Protocol's main contracts:
 * 1. Obtain a Toucan pool token such as BCT or NCT (by performing a token
 *    swap).
 * 2. Redeem the pool token for a TCO2 token.
 * 3. Retire the TCO2 token.
 *
 * These steps are combined in each of the following "auto offset" methods
 * implemented in `OffsetHelper` to allow a retirement within one transaction:
 * - `autoOffsetUsingPoolToken()` if the user already owns a Toucan pool
 *   token such as BCT or NCT,
 * - `autoOffsetUsingETH()` if the user would like to perform a retirement
 *   using MATIC,
 * - `autoOffsetUsingToken()` if the user would like to perform a retirement
 *   using an ERC20 token: USDC, WETH or WMATIC.
 *
 * In these methods, "auto" refers to the fact that these methods use
 * `autoRedeem()` in order to automatically choose a TCO2 token corresponding
 * to the oldest tokenized carbon project in the specfified token pool.
 * There are no fees incurred by the user when using `autoRedeem()`, i.e., the
 * user receives 1 TCO2 token for each pool token (BCT/NCT) redeemed.
 *
 * There are two `view` helper functions `calculateNeededETHAmount()` and
 * `calculateNeededTokenAmount()` that should be called before using
 * `autoOffsetUsingETH()` and `autoOffsetUsingToken()`, to determine how much
 *  MATIC, respectively how much of the ERC20 token must be sent to the
 * `OffsetHelper` contract in order to retire the specified amount of carbon.
